## üß† Model Customization & Training

To train your own YOLO model:

1. Collect and label drone datasets.
2. Configure YOLO model parameters.
3. Run training with:

```bash
python train.py
```

---

## üîÑ Model Conversion

Convert a `.pt` model into a TensorRT `.engine` format for optimized inference:

```bash
cd JetsonYoloV5
python3 gen_wts.py -w yolov5s.pt -o yolov5s.wts
```

Then follow TensorRT build instructions to generate the `.engine` file.

---

## ‚úÖ Testing & Validation

Run the main application:

```bash
python3 app.py
```

This will start real-time drone detection and display live results.
